## Background

This test suite provides interoperability tests for verifiable credential
processors (issuers/verifiers) that support the
[W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).

## Install

```js
npm i
```

## Setup

This test suite uses an HTTP API (based on the
[VC-API](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/)) for passing  credentials into
issuer and verifier implementations. If your implementation is not already
compatible with the VC-API, it is possible to "wrap" the implementation in a
minimal VC-API implementation (example code is available at
<https://github.com/Wind4Greg/Server-for-VCs>).

Additionally, verifier implementations will need to be able to process Verifiable Credentials
and Verifiable Presentations signed with `eddsa-rdfc-2022`. We recommend
that any issuer endpoints used with this test suite also issue using
`eddsa-rdfc-2022`. Both signed and unsigned Verifiable Presentations will
be submitted for verification. Signed Verifiable Presentations from this suite
will have a domain and challenge set. The domain should be the test repo, and
the challenge is static.

#### Required Contexts

Implementations are expected to not error when any of the following context
files are used in a verifiable credential or a verifiable presentation:

- [VC 2.0 Context - https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2](https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2)
- [VC Examples Context - https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2](https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2)

## Usage

To add your implementation to this test suite, add a test manifest describing
your implementation to the
[`w3c/vc-test-suite-implementations`](https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite-implementations)
repo by following the
[Adding a new implementation](https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite-implementations/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-a-new-implementation)
instructions.

All endpoints will need the tag `vc2.0`. A simplified manifest will roughly
look like the following:

```js
{
  "name": "My Company",
  "implementation": "My implementation",
  "issuers": [{
    "id": "",
    "endpoint": "https://issuer.mycompany.com/credentials/issue",
    "tags": ["vc2.0"]
  }],
  "verifiers": [{
    "id": "",
    "endpoint": "https://verifier.mycompany.com/credentials/verify",
    "tags": ["vc2.0"]
  }],
  "vpVerifiers": [{
    "id": "",
    "endpoint": "https://verifier.mycompany.com/presentations/verify",
    "tags": ["vc2.0"]
  }]
}
```

The example above is for a set of unauthenticated endpoints. You can add
[ZCAP](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-spec/)
or [OAuth2 authentication](https://oauth.net/2/client-authentication/) to your endpoints.

See
[Adding a new implementation](https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite-implementations/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-a-new-implementation)
for more information.

### Testing Locally

To test a single implementation or endpoint running locally, you can
copy `localConfig.example.cjs` to `localConfig.cjs`
in the root directory of the test suite.

```bash
cp localConfig.example.cjs localConfig.cjs
```

This file must be a CommonJS module that exports an object containing a
`settings` object (for configuring the test suite code itself) and an
`implementations` array (for configuring the implementation(s) to test against).

The format of the object contained in the `implementations` array is
identical to the one defined in
[the **_Testing locally_** section of VC Test Suite Implementations](https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite-implementations?tab=readme-ov-file#testing-locally).
The `implementations` array may contain more than one implementation object,
enabling you to test multiple implementations in one run.

```js
// localConfig.cjs defines local implementations
// Before running the tests, you can specify a BASE_URL, such as
// BASE_URL=http://localhost:40443/zDdfsdfs npm test
const baseUrl = process.env.BASE_URL || 'https://localhost:40443/id';
module.exports = {
  settings: {
    enableInteropTests: false, // default
    testAllImplementations: false // default
  },
  implementations: [{
    name: 'My Company',
    implementation: 'My Implementation Name',
    issuers: [{
      id: 'did:myMethod:implementation:issuer:id',
      endpoint: `${baseUrl}/credentials/issue`
    }],
    verifiers: [{
      id: 'did:myMethod:implementation:verifier:id',
      endpoint: `${baseUrl}/credentials/verify`
    }]
  }];
```

Then...

```sh
npm test
```

### Allure Reporting
It's also possible to generate local allure reports for analyzing and debugging results. [Allure](https://allurereport.org/) is a language agnostic reporting framework which enables useful features for developers and test-suite designers.

To run the tests and browse the report, use the following commands:
```bash
# Running the tests
npx mocha tests/

# Running the reporting server
allure serve allure-results
```

## Implementation

### Test Suite HTTP API


A request to **issue a credential** (`/credentials/issue`) will look like this:

```http
POST /credentials/issue
```

```json
{
  "credential": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
    ],
    "id": "http://university.example/credentials/1872",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
    "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
    "validFrom": "2023-07-01T19:23:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
      "alumniOf": {
        "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
        "name": "Example University"
      }
    }
  },
  "options": {}
}
```

The response from a call to issue a credential (`/credentials/issue`) will
look like this:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "verifiableCredential": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
    ],
    "id": "http://university.example/credentials/1872",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
    "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
    "validFrom": "2023-07-01T19:23:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
      "alumniOf": {
        "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
        "name": "Example University"
      }
    },
    "proof": {
      "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
      "cryptosuite": "eddsa-rdfc-2022",
      "created": "2023-06-18T21:19:10Z",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "https://university.example/issuers/565049#key-1",
      "proofValue": "zQeVbY4oey...V6doDwLWx"
    }
  }
}
```

A request to the **verifier endpoint** (`/credentials/verify`) for a credential
will look like this:

```http
POST /credentials/verify
```

```json
{
  "verifiableCredential": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
    ],
    "id": "http://university.example/credentials/1872",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
    "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
    "validFrom": "2023-07-01T19:23:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
      "alumniOf": {
        "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
        "name": "Example University"
      }
    },
    "proof": {
      "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
      "cryptosuite": "eddsa-rdfc-2022",
      "created": "2023-06-18T21:19:10Z",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "https://university.example/issuers/565049#key-1",
      "proofValue": "zQeVbY4oey...V6doDwLWx"
    }
  },
  "options": {}
}
```

A response from the verifier endpoint (`/credentials/verify`) for a
verifiable credential might look like this (only HTTP response codes are
checked):

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "results": {},
  "problemDetails": []
}
```

The credential verifier endpoint is based on the
[VC-API Verify Credential](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#verify-credential)
endpoint.

---

A request to the **verifier endpoint** for a presentation
(`/presentations/verify`) will look like this:

```http
POST /presentations/verify
```

```json
{
  "verifiablePresentation": {
    "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"],
    "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
    "holder": "did:example:holder123456789",
    "verifiableCredential": [{
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
      ],
      "id": "http://university.example/credentials/1872",
      "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
      "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
      "validFrom": "2023-07-01T19:23:24Z",
      "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
        "alumniOf": {
          "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
          "name": "Example University"
        }
      },
      "proof": {
        "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
        "cryptosuite": "eddsa-rdfc-2022",
        "created": "2023-06-18T21:19:10Z",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "https://university.example/issuers/565049#key-1",
        "proofValue": "zQeVbY4oey...V6doDwLWx"
      }
    }],
    "proof": {
      "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
      "cryptosuite": "eddsa-rdfc-2022",
      "challenge": "08cf4ce0-2bd0-11ee-8622-83054936f200",
      "domain": "example.com",
      "created": "2023-06-18T21:19:10Z",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "did:example:holder123456789#key-1",
      "proofValue": "zQeVbY4y...oDwLWxV6d"
    }
  },
  "options": {
    "challenge": "secret",
    "domain": "example.com"
  }
}
```

A response from the verifier endpoint (`/credentials/verify`) for a
verifiable presentation might look like this (only HTTP response codes are
checked):

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "problemDetails": []
}
```

The presentation verifier endpoint is based on the
[VC API Verify Presentation](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#verify-presentation) endpoint.

### Enveloping Proof
Implementers who rely on an enveloping proof securing mechanism can add the `EnvelopingProof` tag to their implementation registration.

This will instruct the test suite to conduct further testing on the implementation and assert the Data Model based on the payload instead of the direct output.

```json
{
  "name": "My Company",
  "implementation": "My implementation",
  "issuers": [{
    "id": "",
    "endpoint": "https://issuer.mycompany.com/credentials/issue",
    "tags": ["vc2.0", "EnvelopingProof"]
  }],
  "verifiers": [{
    "id": "",
    "endpoint": "https://verifier.mycompany.com/credentials/verify",
    "tags": ["vc2.0", "EnvelopingProof"]
  }],
  "vpVerifiers": [{
    "id": "",
    "endpoint": "https://verifier.mycompany.com/presentations/verify",
    "tags": ["vc2.0", "EnvelopingProof"]
  }]
}
```
